# Home Assignment - FE - Sports Leagues

**Sporty Group**

### Overview

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your skills in frontend development, especially your proficiency with components based, state management and API integration. The project simulates a simplified component from an online bookmaker platform.

You are free to use any AI tools to assist you with this task, including for UI/UX design, layout generation, or even code scaffolding. If you do use any tools, please include a short .md file describing which ones you used and how they helped. The focus of this assignment is on your understanding of product logic and implementation, not whether everything is handcrafted from scratch.

The task is expected to take approximately 90 minutes. If you're unable to complete all requirements within that time, please provide additional context or explanations in the .md file.

### Requirements

Build a single-page application (SPA) that consumes the All Leagues API and displays the sports leagues with filtering options.

- Fetch and display a list of sports leagues.
- Display Fields:
  - strLeague
  - strSport
  - strLeagueAlternate
- Add a search bar to filter leagues by name.
- Add a dropdown to filter by sport type (e.g., Soccer, Basketball, Motorsport).
- Use component-based architecture.
- The UI should be responsive and functional as a priority; visual enhancements can be added if time allows.
- The league entities respond to clicks and call the Season Badge API with the league ID to display a season badge image (can be for any season you like or the first entity in the response).
- Responses should be cached to avoid repeat calls.

### Tech Stack

The solution is expected to be based on Vue, React or Angular. Other tools/libraries can be used at your discretion.
